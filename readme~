This is an implementation of the Little Man Computer, Created by Stuart Madnick in 1965, as described by its wikipedia entry.

How to use it:

    * put your assembly in the Assembly texarea and click Translate. That will output the machine code in the Machine texarea of the Editor.
    * Load the machine code into memory by clicking Load.
    * The memory should be loaded now. Sorry, you can't edit directly there. If you wish to edit, edit in Editor->Machine and click Load again.
    * Click Run to run your program.
    * If you prefer, you can step through it.
    * Reset will put the counter back to 0, so that you can run your program again
    * I doubt that anyone who would care about this program would need Stop to be explained. Still, Stop should stop your program.
